Serbot is hot, keep reading Lol.

So, lets just get to the point, I’ve showed you Awrs and what it’s capable of, considered as one of the best Reverse Shells I’ve decided to Update Awrs and create Serbot and no, it’s not what you think Lol.

Serbot is an advanced version of Awrs where the Server can be managed by 1 Controller at a time.
Example:
Server hosted on 15.48.158.15 and accepts up to 100 clients through port 1567, accepts 1 Controller at a time through port 2357 and the Controller’s functions are protected with a password: “IAmAPassword”
Client 1 hosted on 86.58.157.25 connected to 15.48.158.15:1567
Client 2 hosted on 78.459.17.35 connected to 15.48.158.15:1567
Controller running on my own computer connected to the Server on 15.48.158.15:2357 using the valid password “IAmAPassword”

In Serbot’s case, the Server also plays the role of a Bridge between the Clients and the Controller. This should sum things up. There’s a lot of benefits out of this now that’s for sure. A team of Researches or Hacktivists can now interact with all their clients using their Controllers, they don’t have to worry about portforwading, reverse shell’s stability and speed etc and they’re all sharing everything they have control on in one place.

In Serbot, everything was dealt with, your Server will never crash nor will your Clients no matter what, check the features list below for more info:
